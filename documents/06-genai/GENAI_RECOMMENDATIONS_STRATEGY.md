## 🏗️ Architecture

### Option 1: **API-Based (Recommended for MVP/POC)**
```
Frontend → Backend API → OpenAI API → Recommendations → Backend → Frontend
```

**Implementation:**
- Backend endpoint: `/api/v1/analytics/{funnel_id}/recommendations`
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo
- Caching layer for cost optimization
- Rate limiting for API protection

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick to implement (1-2 days)
- ✅ No infrastructure setup needed
- ✅ High-quality outputs (GPT-4)
- ✅ Easy to prototype and iterate
- ✅ Can use existing OpenAI API key

**Cons:**
- ❌ API costs per request (~$0.01-0.03 per request)
- ❌ Requires API keys management
- ❌ External dependency
- ❌ Latency (1-3 seconds per request)

**Cost Estimate:**
- GPT-4: ~$0.03 per request (with caching, ~$0.01)
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per request (with caching, ~$0.001)
- Monthly estimate: ~$50-200 for moderate usage (1000-5000 requests/month)
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache recommendations for same data ranges (24h TTL)

### Option 2: **Embedded Model (Future - Production Scale)**
```
Frontend → Backend API → Local LLM (Ollama/LLaMA) → Recommendations → Backend → Frontend
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No API costs
- ✅ Data stays local (privacy)
- ✅ Faster for high-volume
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires model deployment infrastructure
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Lower quality than GPT-4 (but improving)
- ❌ Higher initial setup time

## 💰 Cost Optimization Strategies

### **1. Caching**
- Cache recommendations for same data ranges (24h TTL)
- Cache insights for identical queries
- Use cache keys based on: funnel_id + date_range + filters + segment_by
- **Expected savings**: 60-80% cost reduction

### **2. Model Selection**
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo for simple queries (Q&A, basic insights)
- Use GPT-4 for complex analysis (recommendations, reports)
- **Expected savings**: 90% cost reduction for simple queries

### **3. Prompt Optimization**
- Use structured prompts (better outputs, fewer retries)
- Limit response length where possible
- Use few-shot examples for consistency
- **Expected savings**: 20-30% cost reduction

### **4. Batch Processing**
- Batch similar requests
- Generate reports during off-peak hours
- Pre-generate common reports
- **Expected savings**: 10-15% cost reduction

### **5. Rate Limiting**
- Limit requests per user per day
- Implement request queuing
- Prioritize high-value requests
- **Expected savings**: Prevents cost overruns

### **Cost Estimates**
- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per request (with caching: ~$0.01)
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.002 per request (with caching: ~$0.001)
- **Monthly Estimate** (moderate usage):
  - 1000 complex requests (GPT-4): $30 → $10 with caching
  - 2000 simple requests (GPT-3.5): $4 → $2 with caching
  - **Total**: ~$12-50/month with optimizations
